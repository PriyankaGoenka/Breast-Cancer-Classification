# Breast-Cancer-Classification
Programmed two layer Neural Network and multi-layer Neural Network in Python using Numpy and scikit-learn library with Sigmoid at the 
output layer. For two layer neural network, got an accuracy of 95.9% if Sigmoid is the activation function of the hidden layer and 
an accuracy of 95% if ReLU is the activation function of the hidden layer. For multi-layer neural network got an accuracy of 95.3% 
if Sigmoid is the activation function of the hidden layers and an accuracy of 95.6% if ReLU is the activation function of the hidden layers.
